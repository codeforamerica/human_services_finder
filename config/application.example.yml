# First, copy this file to a new one called "application.yml" in the same
# config directory.

# This file is used by the "figaro" gem to allow you to store and use
# environment variables in the app without having to set them via the
# command line each time you run the app in development.
# Read more about figaro here: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro

# Note that changes to this file will require a server restart to take effect.

# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables
# in the Unix shell. For example, setting:
# OHANA_API_ENDPOINT: http://api.smc-connect.org
# makes "http://api.smc-connect.org" available as
# ENV["OHANA_API_ENDPOINT"] in the app. See config/initializers/ohanapi.rb
# for a usage example.

# Below, you will find descriptions for each variable, followed by default
# settings for the development, production, and test environments.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS
#
####################################

################################
#
# OHANA_API_ENDPOINT - REQUIRED
#
################################
# Set this to the URL for your instance of the Ohana API:
# https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api

#########################
#
# DOMAIN_NAME - REQUIRED
#
#########################
# This setting is used for the Google translation feature.
# The "DOMAIN_NAME" environment variable should be set to your app's
# domain name, without the "www" subdomain, unless you're using a Heroku
# domain, in which case you should set it to your full Heroku domain name,
# such as "ohana-web-search-demo.herokuapp.com".
# If you have a custom domain name, like "www.smc-connect.org", that
# means setting it to "smc-connect.org".
#
# In development, it should only be set to a 2-level domain name,
# like "lvh.me", or "myapp.dev" if you're using Pow.
# Translation won't work with "localhost", so please open the site
# locally via http://lvh.me:{port number}
#
# Read more about lvh.me here:
# http://matthewhutchinson.net/2011/1/10/configuring-subdomains-in-development-with-lvhme
# Pow should work too if you prefer that: http://pow.cx/

# saved for the site. The tag appears in the HTML head and looks like this:
# <meta name="google-translate-customization" content="Your Website Code." />
#
# This code is generated by adding your site to your Google Account
# via the Google Website Translator Gadget Wizard at
# https://translate.google.com/manager/website/

######
# When you visit a location, for example,
# http://ohana-web-search-demo.herokuapp.com/locations/salvation-army/sunnyvale-corps,
# the 'Last updated' time that is displayed at the bottom right of the page is
# set to UTC by default. If you would like to set it to a more appropriate
# time zone where most of your visitors live, you can set the 'TZ' environment
# variable to one of the accepted values:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones.
# For example, to set the time zone to Eastern Time, you would set the 'TZ'
# value to 'America/New_York'.
