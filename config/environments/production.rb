  # Settings specified here will take precedence over those in config/application.rb.

  # Thanks to the "rack-rewrite" gem, the code in lines 38-53 will redirect all
  # URLs that don't come from the domain specified in the canonica_url variable
  # to the canonical URL equivalent. Full URLs are preserved
  # (i.e. including path and parameters).
  #
  # This is necessary if search engines have been indexing your site while it
  # was hosted on herokuapp.com, and you later set up a custom domain name.
  # Adding a custom domain on Heroku does not automatically redirect the heroku
  # domain to your custom domain, which leaves your site accessible via two
  # different domain names, which major search engines consider duplicate
  # content and can count against you.
  # By setting up this permanent redirect (via the HTTP 301 status code),
  # you tell search engines that the canonical URL is the one you prefer, and
  # it prevents them from continuing to index the duplicate content.
  #
  # Google's recommendations for canonicalization:
  # https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066
  #
  # When deploying, set the environment variable to your desired URL.
  # For example, if you want the URL to be "smc-connect.org" and you
  # are deploying to Heroku, you would use the command line to run this from
  # your app's directory: heroku config:set CANONICAL_URL=smc-connect.org
  #
  # To test the redirection in development, you can set the environment
  # variable in config/application.yml by adding this line:
  # CANONICAL_URL: smc-connect.org (or whatever URL you want).
  # Alternatively, you can export the environment variable
  # locally by running this command from the directory of your app:
  # export CANONICAL_URL=smc-connect.org
  #
  # Then copy and paste lines 38-53 from this file into
  # config/environments/development.rb and restart your server.
  # Don't forget to remove the redirection code from development.rb
  # when you're done testing.
