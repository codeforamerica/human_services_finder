#Ohana SMC

A brand new project underway by [Code for America's 2013 San Mateo County](http://codeforamerica.org/2013-partners/san-mateo-county/) fellowship team. We have acquired the Peninsula Library System's [Community Information Program](http://cip.plsinfo.org) — a dataset of community resources in San Mateo County — which we plan to make available via an API over the next few months.

This app serves as an example of what can be built with that data, although this app is not consuming the API yet. The goal is to build an interface that makes it easy to find available services in San Mateo County, and to provide as much pertinent information as possible, such as travel directions, hours of operation, other services residents in need might be eligible for, etc.

This repo is in the early stages of development, but we've reached a stable point where we are ready to accept contributions. Below you will find instructions for installing the project and contributing.

## Installation
Please note that the instructions below have only been tested on OS X. If you are running another operating system and run into any issues, feel free to update this README, or open an issue if you are unable to resolve installation issues.

###Prerequisites

#### Git, Ruby 2.0.0+, Rails 3.2.13+ (+ Homebrew on OS X)
**OS X**: [Set up a dev environment on OS X with Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby, and Rails](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

**Windows**: Try [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org), along with some of these [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+rails+on+windows) if you get stuck.


#### MongoDB
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB (or almost any development tool) is with Homebrew:

    brew update
    brew install mongodb

Follow the Homebrew instructions for configuring MongoDB

Launch mongodb in a separate Terminal tab or window:

    mongod

**Other**

See the Downloads page on mongodb.org for steps to install on other systems: [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)


#### Redis
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install Redis is with Homebrew:

    brew install redis

Follow the Homebrew instructions if you want Redis to start automatically every time you restart your computer. Otherwise launch Redis in a separate Terminal tab or window:

    redis-server

**Other**

See the Download page on Redis.io for steps to install on other systems: [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download)

### Clone the app on your local machine:

    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/human_services_finder.git
    cd human_services_finder

### Install the dependencies:

    bundle

### Load the data
You can load two datasets — farmers' markets and libraries in San Mateo County — in your local db with this command:

    rake load_data

Create the geospatial indices for the [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) gem:

    rake db:mongoid:create_indexes

### Run the app
Start the app locally using Unicorn:

    unicorn

Ohana SMC should now be running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Test the app
To test locally, you will need to run this once to set up the test DB:

    rake db:mongoid:create_indexes RAILS_ENV=test

Then you can run tests with this simple command:

    rspec

For faster tests:

    gem install zeus
    zeus start #in a separate Terminal window or tab
    zeus rspec spec 

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/codeforamerica/human_services_finder/tree/master/spec) directory.

## Submitting an Issue
We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/codeforamerica/human_services_finder/issues) to track bugs and features. Before submitting a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted. When submitting a bug report, please include a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) that includes a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug, including your gem version, Ruby version, and operating system. Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. [Fork the repository.][fork]
2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]
3. Add specs for your unimplemented feature or bug fix.
4. Run `rspec`. If your specs pass, return to step 3. In the spirit of Test-Driven Development, you want to write a failing test first, then implement the feature or bug fix to make the test pass.
5. Implement your feature or bug fix.
6. Run `rspec`. If your specs fail, return to step 5.
7. Add, commit, and push your changes.
8. [Submit a pull request.][pr]
