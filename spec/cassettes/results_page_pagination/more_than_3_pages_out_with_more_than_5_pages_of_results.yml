        reports of situations in which children age 17 or under may be in jeopardy
        because of abuse, abandonment, sexual molestation, exploitation or neglect.
        When the home situation is such that the child needs to be placed under the
        protection of the juvenile court, this unit initiates court action, conducts
        an investigation and supervises children who have been removed from parental
        custody. Can make immediate placements in emergency shelter care when children
        are endangered. May also aid children by providing casework and related services
        to their families, and making referrals to appropriate agencies.                  A
        report may be made in person, by phone or letter and may be anonymous, though
        all names are held confidential. Anyone initiating a referral in good faith
        is immune from liability. Provides information and refers within the agency
        for all specialized children''s services. Counseling, support groups and in-home
        services can be provided to families receiving protective services supervision
        from this agency. Provides shelter care for children, age 18 or under, who
        need to be removed from their own homes because they are in danger due to
        neglect, abuse, abandonment, exploitation or other family crisis. Young children
        are placed in temporary foster homes. Adolescents are placed in the central
        receiving home. All requests for emergency care or removal of a child from
        a home in crisis must be made through the Hotline or the local police department.
        The county is a state-licensed adoption and foster home licensing agency providing
        services to birth parents, pre-adoptive children, adoptive and foster parent
        applicants. Provides information about adoption procedures to birth parents.
        Children are generally of school age, of minority or mixed background or have
        special problems. Written application, office and home interviews are necessary.
        Provides post-adoption services to assist adoptees, birth parents or adoptive
        parents. Provides relinquishment adoption services. Does not provide intercountry
        adoption services. Helps to arrange for out-of-home placement of children,
        age 17 or under, in group homes or institutions. Families must meet certain
        criteria in order for the children to be considered for placement. This unit
        cannot handle the placement of delinquents or children beyond parental control.
        This office also licenses foster family homes throughout the county as required
        by law for care on a regular basis of a non-related child age 17 or under.
        Homes are licensed for one year and renewed annually. Will investigate complaints
        or reports of persons caring for non-related children without a license or
        of licensed persons giving improper care. The Foster Care Eligibility line
        handles questions related to payments to foster parents, non-related guardians,
        and relatives. Speakers are available for clubs or groups who wish to know
        more about foster care, \"fostadopt\" and adoptions. For matters other than
        court investigations, licensing, shelter care or adoptions, please contact
        the appropriate regional office. For East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, or Redwood
        City residents, contact the South County office at 650-363-4218. For San Carlos,

        Board of Supervisors and the Aging and Adult Services Division on issues concerning
        older adults (age 60 or over). The public is invited to attend the monthly
        general meetings of the Commission on Aging, as well as to participate on
        its standing committees. - The Community-based Continuum of Care serves as
        a planning, advocacy and information-sharing committee on a variety of long-term
        care programs designed to maximize the independence of older adults and adults
        with disabilities. - The Legislative/Advocacy Committee reviews pending legislation
        and advocates on behalf of older adults. - The Minority Elders Committee develops
        strategies and activities to increase effective communication, reduce barriers
        to specific services and enhance responsiveness of services to San Mateo County''s
        diverse population of older adults. - The Nutrition Committee provides a focal
        point for the discussion of nutrition-related issues. In addition to receiving
        consumer input, the committee assists in fundraising and educating consumers
        about nutrition issues. - The Housing Committee is a joint committee of the
        Commission on Aging and the Commission on Disabilities which promotes both
        affordable and accessible housing opportunities for older adults and people
        with disabilities. In addition to its standing committees, the Commission
        on Aging may establish ad hoc committees or task forces to address emergent
        issues not covered by its standing committees. It also establishes liaison
        relationships with a number other committees and task forces in the County

        The warehouse is open the first and third Thursday from 3 to 4 pm. There are
        five latex paint collection locations throughout the county. This paint is
