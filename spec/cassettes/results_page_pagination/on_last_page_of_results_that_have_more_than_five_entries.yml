        agency Web site at www.mhasmc.org The Housing and Client Assistance Program
        provides short-term assistance to low-income persons with HIV/AIDS in obtaining
        and maintaining permanent housing. Financial assistance is provided in the
        form of partial rent payments to landlords and mortgage lenders. Depending
        on financial need, the program may also help pay utility bills, WELL Program
        enrollment fees, temporary co-payments for prescribed medication and temporary
        shelter in a motel. Case managers can refer participants for other services
        including medical care, social work services, drug and alcohol treatment,
        food and transportation. Support and Advocacy for Young Adults in Transition
        (SAYAT) provides case management to assist young adults with disabilities
        who do not qualify for county mental health services or other case management
        services. Belmont Apartments offer affordable and supportive housing for 24
        homeless adults with mental illness (many of whom are dually or triply diagnosed).
        CHRIS (Community Housing Rehabilitation Independent Skills) Program strengthens
        the living skills of persons with mental illness. Occupational therapists
        and interns provide assessments, training, and specific interventions, and
        physical adaptations to allow these adults to participate in the community
        at the highest level of independence possible.","emails":["info@mhasmc.org"],"faxes":["650
