        operates and maintains the public bus system in the county. In addition to
        local service, some routes extend into San Francisco and Palo Alto and others
        connect to BART and Caltrain stations in the county, including the San Francisco
        International Airport. The regular fare of $2 covers adult travel on local
        routes. The regular fare for youth (age 17 or under) is $1.25. The regular
        fare for seniors, patrons with disabilities and Medicare cardholders is $1.
        The Express route between San Mateo County and San Francisco charges $5. Call
        for information on pass programs and exact fares. Disabled persons holding
        a Regional Transit Connection discount card may ride all local SamTrans routes
        for $1. Senior Citizens also may ride at the discounted fare. Although it
        is not necessary that senior citizens carry a Regional Transit Connection
        discount card to receive a discount, cards will be issued to any senior citizen
        who wants one. The Regional Transit Connection discount card can be used on
        all Bay Area public transit systems. Seniors age 65 or over with proof of
        age, and disabled persons with an application signed by a physician, may obtain
        the photo identification card at a cost of $3 by coming to the SamTrans office
        in San Carlos on Tuesday or Thursday, 9 am-4 pm. Phone for details on eligibility.
        SamTrans contracts for the operation of Redi-Wheels and RediCoast, the paratransit
        service for the mobility impaired, described separately. Redi-Wheels serves
        the bayside of the county, while RediCoast serves the coastside. SamTrans
