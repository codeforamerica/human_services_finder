        examination and a drug test.   Work/learn projects include building trails,
        salmon restoration, developing public parks, assisting in emergency disaster
        relief work, fighting fires, planting trees and protecting wildlife. GED and
        high school diploma classes are held several evenings a week. Up to $2,000
