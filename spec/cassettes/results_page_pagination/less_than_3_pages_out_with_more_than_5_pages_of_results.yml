        of food and fiber, and learn about natural resources through trail walks in
        the coastal hills.   The Ranch is home to sheep, goats, chickens, rabbits,
        horse, miniature donkeys and a variety of wildlife. The horticulture areas
        offer endless opportunities to learn about gardening and nutrition by becoming
        involved in planting, harvesting and developing menus. Areas have been adapted
        for the use of visitors with special needs. Adults, teachers and guardians
        are given the opportunity to plan the day''s curriculum. Resident and day
        camps are held during the summer. The 4,000-square-foot Conference Center
