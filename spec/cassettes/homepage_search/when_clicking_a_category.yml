        parents with issues and questions relating to the establishment of child support.
        The department establishes paternity, medical support orders, child support
        orders, and oversees the enforcement of these orders. Persons who have a child
        support and/or medical support order, or want to establish one, can apply
        for services. Parents who receive public assistance, including Medi-Cal, will

        Services (SMC/DCSS) by the County of San Mateo Human Services Agency. If paternity
        (fatherhood) has not yet been established, the SMC/DCSS will take the necessary
        steps to establish paternity. (Paternity must be established before child
        and medical support can be ordered by the court.)  If a court order for child
        support does not already exist, and the noncustodial parent is located, one
        will be sought by the SMC/DCSS and established by the court based on both
        parents'' ability to pay support, the amount of time the child spends with
        each parent, and the financial needs of the child. The SMC/DCSS will also
        request that the court require the noncustodial parent to provide health insurance
        if it is available at a reasonable cost. The SMC/DCSS will take steps to enforce
        court orders for child support and medical support. Enforcement action will
        be taken by the SMC/DCSS if the noncustodial parent does not pay or pays less
        than the amount ordered, or if the noncustodial parent does not provide health
        insurance for the child as ordered by the court. The SMC/DCSS will determine
