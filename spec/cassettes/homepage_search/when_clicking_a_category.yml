        Social Security benefits are based on the worker''s wages and may be paid
        to the worker or the worker''s dependents or survivors. People in need of
        cash aid who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled including blind
        and disabled children, may apply for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI
        recipients automatically qualify for Medi-Cal. Medicare is the federal health
        insurance program for people age 65 or over and those who are disabled or
        have chronic kidney disease. It is best to check first the Web site for information
        about qualifications and the necessary documentation which must be submitted.
        Interim emergency financial assistance may be obtained from the San Mateo
        County Human Services Agency. Applications for homebound persons can be handled

        The department establishes paternity, medical support orders, child support
        orders, and oversees the enforcement of these orders. Persons who have a child
        support and/or medical support order, or want to establish one, can apply

        (fatherhood) has not yet been established, the SMC/DCSS will take the necessary
        steps to establish paternity. (Paternity must be established before child
        and medical support can be ordered by the court.)  If a court order for child
        support does not already exist, and the noncustodial parent is located, one

        cash aid who are age 65 or over, or who are blind or disabled including blind

        have chronic kidney disease. It is best to check first the Web site for information
        about qualifications and the necessary documentation which must be submitted.
        Interim emergency financial assistance may be obtained from the San Mateo
