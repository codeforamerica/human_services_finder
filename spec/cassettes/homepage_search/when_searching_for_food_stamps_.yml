        for Needy Families (TANF) Program. It is a time-limited public assistance
        program to help meet the needs of families and/or children when the child
        is deprived of parental support because one or both of the child''s parents
        are absent, deceased, incapacitated or unemployed. The program helps parents
        prepare for work and find jobs. Its goal is to strengthen the access of low-income
        parents to the resources necessary to support their children and become self-sufficient

        payment for work- or training-related expenses, job referral, retention and
        advancement assistance. Income and resource limits must be met to be eligible.   The
        Food Stamp Program is for low-income and public assistance households that
        meet an established-need standard for Food Stamp eligibility. SSI/SSP recipients
        are not eligible receive Food Stamps but elderly immigrants who receive CAPI
        are eligible for Food Stamps. The Medi-Cal program pays for health care for
        eligible and needy low-income residents of California: families meeting the
        CalWORKs deprivation criteria, pregnant women, children age 21 or under, refugees
        in their first eight months of residence in the U.S., severely disabled persons
        and persons age 65 or over. The Refugee Resettlement Program and Refugee Cash
        Assistance program provides cash and medical assistance and funds for refugees.
        It also funds employment and training services. Refugee families with children
        who meet the income and property limits may be eligible for CalWORKs. Adult
