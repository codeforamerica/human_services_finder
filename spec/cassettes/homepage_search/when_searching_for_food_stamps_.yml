        age 17-20 who need a safe place to stay while working out family problems,

        process includes having the teenager meet personally with a staff member who

        services. Usually three or four teens live in the home at one time. Staff
        also can work with teens living elsewhere. Publishes a bimonthly newsletter.   Escuela
        Para Mujeres, also known as the Catholic Worker Language School, provides
        free classes in the English language (ESL) primarily to low-income Hispanic

        weekends at 822 Heller Street, Redwood City. Call 650-366-8315 for more information
        or to volunteer. Tutoring for elementary age school children is also available.
