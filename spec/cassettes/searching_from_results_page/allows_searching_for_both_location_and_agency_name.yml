        free primary and specialty medical and dental services to uninsured, low-income
        residents. Who is Treated? Patients of our clinics are the working poor. They
        tend to earn just enough income to be ineligible for Medi-Cal coverage, yet
        do not receive health insurance through their employers and cannot afford
        to pay for “out-of-pocket” health insurance. Often these residents are forced
        to seek treatment at local emergency rooms and become saddled with medical
        bills that they are unable to pay. Samaritan House’s Free Medical Clinics
        fill this gap in healthcare access for the uninsured and save emergency room
        resources for emergencies. Professional Medical \u0026 Dental Volunteers Thanks
        to its innovative volunteer-based model of service, Samaritan House’s clinics
        are able to treat such a large number of patients with a very small paid staff.
        Almost all of the medical and dental doctors and assistants are volunteering
        their time free of charge. These individuals, either retired or currently
        practicing medicine and dentistry, want to serve their community in their
        limited spare time.","kind":"Human Services","latitude":37.5326926,"longitude":-122.2931271,"name":"San
